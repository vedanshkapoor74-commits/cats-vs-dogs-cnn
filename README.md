# Cats vs Dogs CNN Project

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features
- Dataset: Cats vs Dogs from TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model with 3 Conv2D layers + Dense layers
- Training with EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint
- Accuracy & Loss plots
- Visualize predictions on validation batch
- Predict on uploaded images
- Saved model for reuse

## How to run
1. Open `Cats_vs_Dogs_CNN.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Run all cells in order
3. Use the "Upload your own image" cell to test new images

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)
